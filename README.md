# Bixby_DinoDex

This is an attempt to learn how to use vocab and training in a bixby capsule. The idea is to make something like a pokedex but for dinosaurs. To start I have used 20 of the largest dinosaurs of their respective types. This is still unfinished but should come to the bixby marketplace soon.
